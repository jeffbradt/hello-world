Trying Out GitHub.

My name is Jeffrey Paul Bradt. I am a musician and an electronics technician who currently lives in Buffalo, NY and plans to move to Reno, NV this year (2015).
I am trying out GitHub for the first time today, and am simply getting to know it. I don't know whether I will ever actually use it, but it's worth having an account.
